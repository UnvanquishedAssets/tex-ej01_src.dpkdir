[_Forlorn_](../map-forlorn_src.dpkdir/README.md) is a game level featuring a desolate mineral processing plant on a frozen planet for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project. This is the texture set originally designed for this map.

This texture set is a work in progress by Jack “EmperorJack” Purvis for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

This texture set is meant to be used with a level editor like [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/).

Visit the [Unvanquished website](https://unvanquished.net/) for more information about the game itself.
