		Development."
	
	~Usage instructions
	
		The ej01 set has two variant packs, tex-ej01-clean and tex-ej01-ice(this one).
		Both packs have different diffuse/specular maps but share the same normal maps.
		The normal maps are contained within the pack tex-ej01-common. Both variant packs
		are dependent on this common pack. To work with this pack you need the common
		pack installed.

        Made intentionally for Unvanquished Development. Though shader is compatible
		with any quake engine derivative, the .crn format used for Unvanquished may
		not be compatible with these engines. You may ask for the original .tga
		version of the texture pack from me personally.
